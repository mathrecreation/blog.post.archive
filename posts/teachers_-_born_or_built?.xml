A very interesting article in the NYT Magazine, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07Teachers-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;emc=eta1"&gt;Building a Better Teacher&lt;/a&gt;, by Elizabeth Green came out earlier this week. On page 8 of the article, Green writes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Working with Hyman Bass, a mathematician at the University of Michigan, Ball began to theorize that while &lt;b&gt;teaching math obviously required subject knowledge, the knowledge seemed to be something distinct from what she had learned in math class.&lt;/b&gt; Itâ€™s one thing to know that 307 minus 168 equals 139; it is another thing to be able understand why a third grader might think that 261 is the right answer. &lt;b&gt;Mathematicians need to understand a problem only for themselves; math teachers need both to know the math and to know how 30 different minds might understand (or misunderstand) it&lt;/b&gt;. Then they need to take each mind from not getting it to mastery. And they need to do this in 45 minutes or less.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And these are not even the most interesting observations that the article makes.</content>
